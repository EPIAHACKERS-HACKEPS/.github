## Welcome to EPIAHackers!

We are a dynamic group of students who embarked on the thrilling journey of participating in a hackathon and discovered a shared passion for innovation and collaboration. What started as a singular adventure evolved into a close-knit team that continues to explore the exciting world of hackathons.

## Our Story

As a group of enthusiastic learners, we decided to challenge ourselves and participate in a hackathon, drawn by the promise of problem-solving, creativity, and the chance to build something extraordinary. Little did we know that this initial experience would spark a fire within us, leading to the formation of EPIAHackers.

## Why EPIAHackers?

EPIAHackers was born out of the incredible bond we forged during that first hackathon. We not only enjoyed the challenges and late-night coding sessions but also found joy in working together towards a common goal. The synergy among us was undeniable, and it fueled our decision to continue participating in hackathons as a team.

## Our Mission

Our mission is to explore, innovate, and push the boundaries of what we can achieve collectively. We believe in the power of collaboration, creativity, and continuous learning. Through our experiences in hackathons, we aim to not only develop technical skills but also foster a sense of camaraderie and teamwork.
